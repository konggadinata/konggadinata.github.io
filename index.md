I am a research fellow in Nanyang Technological University (NTU) under the group of [Koh Teck Seng](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/kohteckseng/index.html). Previously, I obtained my Bachelor of Science in NTU, and my PhD in [Centre for Quantum Technologies](https://www.quantumlah.org/) (National University of Singapore) under the supervision of Dagomir Kaszlikowski.

 My primary research interest is in the use of negative probability to study different aspects of quantum foundations, quantum information, and quantum computing.
